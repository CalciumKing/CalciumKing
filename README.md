## üöÄ My Coding Journey:

I began my journey into programming at Old Colony Regional Vocational Technical High School, where I majored in Computer
Science. It was there that I learned the foundations of coding ‚Äî languages like Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and
C#. More importantly, it was there that I discovered how much I genuinely loved programming.

High school didn't just teach me how to write code ‚Äî it sparked something deeper. That initial spark quickly became
a fire. After school, I would head home not to relax, but to dive deeper: teaching myself programming concepts, learning
conventions, exploring new languages, and trying to understand not just how code works, but why.

That curiosity pushed me beyond the classroom. Whether I was writing batch scripts to automate Wi-Fi connections,
simulating man-in-the-middle attacks on Raspberry Pis, or building facial recognition algorithms with Python, I was
constantly experimenting and challenging myself.

Now, I‚Äôm continuing that path in higher education ‚Äî aiming to become either a software developer or a cyber-security
specialist. No matter where I land, I‚Äôll keep learning, building, and breaking ‚Äî because that‚Äôs what I love most.
